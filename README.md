# Hey, I’m Rowan Celestino  

I’m a **Data Analyst** with a background in **Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)** and a passion for transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights.  
I build **dashboards, SQL queries, and Python analyses** that help teams make smarter business decisions.  

My goal: land a **data analytics role** where I can apply my skills in **SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel** while continuously learning and growing.
